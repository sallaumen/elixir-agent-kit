# Workflow catalog

Choose the area first, then the narrowest trigger. [ROUTING.md](ROUTING.md) explains
neighboring skills and when no workflow is needed. Read the [shared contract](CONTRACT.md)
with the selected workflow. The installed project index points here after `mix deps.get`.
No individual native skill files are registered in consumer projects.

## Frontend and user experience

| Workflow | Default mode | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| [ui-identity](skills/ui-identity/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when a working interface lacks product-specific hierarchy, identity or visual coherence. |

| [responsive-mobile](skills/responsive-mobile/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when mobile navigation, browser history or layouts fail across phone and wide-screen sizes. |
| [direct-interactions](skills/direct-interactions/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when a simple selection or adjustment requires excessive forms and disconnected controls. |
| [accessibility](skills/accessibility/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when controls, forms, dialogs or asynchronous changes may exclude keyboard or assistive-technology users. |
| [design-system](skills/design-system/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when teams repeat interface mistakes or create incompatible component and token variations. |
| [asset-lineage](skills/asset-lineage/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when previews or generated assets lack clear source, version, orientation or ownership. |

## Backend and data

| Workflow | Default mode | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| [abstraction-layers](skills/abstraction-layers/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when functions mix business decisions, low-level details and effects at incompatible levels. |
| [module-design](skills/module-design/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when module names, locations or public APIs obscure responsibilities that are already understood. |
| [data-contracts](skills/data-contracts/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when layers disagree about data, rules are duplicated or a write leaves records inconsistent. |
| [ai-orchestration](skills/ai-orchestration/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when agent jobs, queues, workers and model capacity are conflated or incorrectly accounted for. |
| [notifications](skills/notifications/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when bots or notifications fail, repeat or produce unexplained message volume. |
| [integration-setup](skills/integration-setup/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when an integration looks configured but required steps or operational readiness remain unclear. |
| [commercial-eligibility](skills/commercial-eligibility/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when an offering is presented without evidence that its exact variant and destination are supported. |
| [metrics-costs](skills/metrics-costs/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when totals, model costs or operational metrics have unclear scope, origin or meaning. |
| [operational-alerts](skills/operational-alerts/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when alerts repeat, historical incidents look current or acknowledging an alert appears to resolve it. |
| [simulation-isolation](skills/simulation-isolation/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when simulation, training or demo flows share code and data paths with real operations. |
| [security-boundaries](skills/security-boundaries/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when untrusted input, credentials, permissions or tenant boundaries may permit unintended access. |
| [migration-compatibility](skills/migration-compatibility/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when stored schemas, identifiers, jobs or public payloads must survive a version change. |

## Cross-cutting engineering

| Workflow | Default mode | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| [architecture-review](skills/architecture-review/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when changes cross many modules, rules repeat, dependencies cycle or domain ownership is unclear. |
| [code-consolidation](skills/code-consolidation/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when unfinished features, abandoned paths or competing implementations make a codebase ambiguous. |
| [version-lineage](skills/version-lineage/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when revisions, previews, selections or generated artifacts are associated with the wrong version. |
| [performance](skills/performance/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when measured latency, freezes, excessive work or rendering cost affects a real workflow. |
| [async-state](skills/async-state/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when progress stalls, success appears too early or stale asynchronous results overwrite current state. |
| [test-consolidation](skills/test-consolidation/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when duplicated tests slow maintenance without protecting distinct failure modes. |
| [test-strategy](skills/test-strategy/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when a passing suite misses important bugs or the required regression coverage is unclear. |
| [code-review](skills/code-review/SKILL.md) | review | Use when reviewing a bounded diff or pull request for actionable defects and regressions. |
| [debugging](skills/debugging/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when a wrong result, exception or intermittent failure has no demonstrated root cause. |

## Delivery and build

| Workflow | Default mode | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| [delivery-coordination](skills/delivery-coordination/SKILL.md) | coordinate | Use when consolidating a product or dividing an authorized change into reviewable deliveries. |
| [pipeline-design](skills/pipeline-design/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when validation pipelines lack clear ownership, local/CI parity or predictable command effects. |
| [build-dependencies](skills/build-dependencies/SKILL.md) | analyze-and-fix | Use when dependencies, builds or CI fail or behave differently across environments. |
| [delivery-validation](skills/delivery-validation/SKILL.md) | analyze | Use when checking whether an integrated change actually satisfies its acceptance criteria. |
